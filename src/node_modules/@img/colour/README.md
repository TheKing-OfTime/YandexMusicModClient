# `@img/colour`

The latest version of the
[color](https://www.npmjs.com/package/color)
package is now ESM-only,
however some JavaScript runtimes do not yet support this,
which includes versions of Node.js prior to 20.19.0.

This package converts the `color` package and its dependencies,
all of which are MIT-licensed, to CommonJS.
